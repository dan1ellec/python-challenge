# Python Challenge


## PyBank

### Task

To create a Python script for analysing the financial records of a company from a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

### Process

Created a Python script that analyses the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The script prints the following analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

```text
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $38382578.0
Average Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
```

## PyPoll

### Task

To help a small, rural town modernise its vote counting process using a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. 


### Process

Created a Python script that analyses the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The script prints the following analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

  ```text
